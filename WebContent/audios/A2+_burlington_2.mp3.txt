Jake:	Hey Holly, why didn't you meet us at the café last night? What were you doing?
Holly:	I was playing a game on my tablet, Jake.
Jake:	What game is it?
Holly:	Clue.
Jake:	Clue? How do you play that?
Holly:	Well, you need to investigate a crime. There was a murder and you try to discover who the murderer was, what weapon they used and where the murder happened.
Jake:	My brother and I used to play a similar game, but we didn't play it on a tablet.
Holly:	Really?
Jake:	Yes, it was a board game - Cluedo. It was very old. My dad got it for his tenth birthday and he often played it while he was growing up.
Holly:	Have you still got the game?
Jake:	I don't know. We used to keep it in a cupboard in the dining room. Let's look for it ..... . There are a lot of old things in this cupboard. Oh, here it is!
Holly:	Oh, look at all the pieces! Cool!
Jake:	Yes, there are six characters and they're all different colours; Miss Scarlett – red, Colonel Mustard – yellow, Mrs Peacock – blue, Professor Plum – purple, Mrs White – white and Reverend Green ...
Holly:	Green!
Jake:	Yes, of course! My favourite character is Professor Plum, but my dad likes Mrs White.
Holly:	Look, there are six tiny weapons. I like the knife and the gun.
Jake:	Yes, and the board is an old English house with nine rooms. I like the library. That's a great place for a murder!
Holly:	So how do you play it?
Jake:	Well, it's like your computer game. Players need to find out how Mr Black died. They need to discover the murderer, the weapon and where the murder happened. They move around the board collecting weapons and characters. Then they ask questions like: Was it Colonel Mustard with the gun in the kitchen?
Holly:	Or ... was it Professor Plum with the knife in the library?
Jake:	Exactly!
Holly:	The game sounds like fun. Can we play it?
Jake:	Yes, sure. Which character do you want to be?
