Peter:	Wendy, can you help me? I want to buy something new for my room. Look at this website. They've got amazing things.
Wendy:	Let me see, Peter. Hey, this stuff is great! Look, that's a nice rug. Have you got a rug in your room?
Peter:	Yes, I have. I've got a big red rug.
Wendy:	OK. So a rug isn't a good idea. Oh, look â€“ there are beautiful curtains. Are there any curtains on your window?
Peter:	Yes, there are.
Wendy:	What colour are they?
Peter:	They're also red. There's a red blanket on my bed, too.
Wendy:	What about something in a different colour? Maybe something blue or green?
Peter:	No, I like red. It's my favourite colour.
Wendy:	Yes, I can see that! What about pillows? Have you got any pillows on your bed?
Peter:	Yes - six. I've got a big bed.
Wendy:	OK, so forget about a new pillow. I know. Maybe a lamp. Do you like this lamp?
Peter:	Yes, but I've got a lamp.
Wendy:	Where is it?
Peter:	It's on my desk. I do homework at my desk at night.
Wendy:	Yeah, me too. How about some posters? There are some nice posters on the website.
Peter:	There are posters on all my walls and on the cupboard. I've got posters of my favourite celebrities.
Wendy:	OK, that's it, I give up!
