Holly:	Hello, and welcome to Holly Can Help. On our programme, you tell me your problem, and hopefully, I'll be able to help you solve it! Our first caller is Julie. Hello, Julie, how can I help you?
Julie:	Hi, Holly. I want to talk to you about my best friend. She really is a fantastic friend and we always get along well with each other.
Holly:	Great! But if she's such a fantastic friend, what's the problem?
Julie:	The problem is she wants to be with me all the time. It's not enough for her that we sit next to each other in class all day. Even when we're not together, she chats with me on the Internet. She's my best friend and she's kind and reliable. She's really lively, too - lots of fun to be with. But not all the time. I don't know what to do. I won't be able to tell her that I need my space and not hurt her feelings.
Holly:	Hmmm, that is a problem! It's clear you need to talk to her and explain how you feel, but you should also offer her a solution.
Julie:	What do you suggest?
Holly:	Well, you could invite other friends to hang out with you and your best friend. It might help her make some new friends.
Julie:	That sounds like a good idea. I'll try! Thanks, Holly!
Holly:	You're welcome, Julie. I'm glad I was able to help.
