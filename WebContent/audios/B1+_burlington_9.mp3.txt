Presenter: This week, our guest on the show is going to tell us about a special kind of disco called Sencity. Good morning, Charlie.
Charlie: 	Good morning, Lauren.
Presenter: So, what is a Sencity disco and what's so special about it?
Charlie: 	Well, in the past, discos used to just have music and lights, but we're interested in stimulating all the senses. We want people to get used to using their sense of smell, taste and touch as well as sight and hearing to appreciate and react to the music. The whole idea started as an alternative experience for deaf people, but people who don't suffer from hearing loss enjoy coming to Sencity, too. So now the Sencity events are totally inclusive. Anyone can go.
Presenter: So what happens at a Sencity disco?
Charlie: 	Well, there's a traditional DJ, or disc jockey, who plays the music, but there's also an "aroma jockey" who adds to the atmosphere by releasing smells into the air. These aromas reflect the passion and emotion in the music. Sometimes there's a "food jockey", too.
Presenter: A food jockey?
Charlie: 	Yes! So you get taste sensations if you feel like eating as well as dancing. And again, these are linked to the music that's playing. Everything is connected. The idea is that the tastes match the sounds.
Presenter: It sounds like fun!
Charlie: 	Yes, it is! And another thing at Sencity is a "sense floor".
Presenter: A sense floor? What's that? I imagine it's some kind of dance floor.
Charlie: 	Yes, but it vibrates in time to the music and it lights up with flashing colours. It feels a bit strange at first, but once you're used to it, it's great fun!
Presenter: Well, Charlie, I can't wait to check it out.
