Sue: 	Hi Peter, how are you?
Peter: 	Hi Sue. Not so good, actually. I've got a pain in my back. I think I might have a problem with my spine.
Sue: 	Oh, you poor thing. Have you seen a doctor?
Peter: 	Yes. I went to the doctor last week. He said there was nothing wrong with me. He said it must be psychological. But I think he's wrong.
Sue: 	You should try alternative medicine. When my dad had a stomach problem, the doctor told him that there was nothing wrong with him, too. So he went to a traditional Chinese doctor and he cured him in weeks.
Peter: 	Really? So, what's so different about traditional Chinese medicine then?
Sue: 	Well, Chinese doctors don't just look at the place where your problem is. They look at the whole person. They believe that health problems happen when our vital energy stops flowing properly.
Peter: 	Vital energy?
Sue: 	Yes. They call it "chi". It's the energy that keeps us alive as it moves in our body.
Peter: 	The same "chi" as in Tai Chi? The martial art?
Sue: 	Exactly! The same word. In fact, Chinese medicine and Tai Chi originate from the same ancient Chinese philosophy - Taoism.
Peter: 	Yes, I've heard of that.
Sue: 	It's all about getting the correct balance between two opposing energies - yin and yang - in order to keep your vital energy flowing through your body.
Peter: 	So what kind of things do they do?
Sue: 	Well, they use acupuncture, herbal remedies and that kind of thing.
Peter: 	You know what? I think I'll go and see this Chinese doctor. It might help me and if it doesn't work, it can't do any harm. At least I hope not.
