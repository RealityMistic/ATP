Mia:	Look at this picture, Luke. Do you know what sport these men are playing?
Luke:	Oh, that's sepak takraw, Mia. It's a sport from Asia, but it's very popular in Europe and the USA, too.
Mia:	Sepak takraw – well, it might be popular, but it's new to me. How do you play it?
Luke:	Well, it's a combination of volleyball and football. In fact, in some countries it's called kick-volleyball.
Mia:	Volleyball and football together? It sounds interesting. So where do you play it?
Luke:	You play it on a court that's got a high net. The court can be inside or outside, so it's great in all weather. The teams must hit the ball over the net to the other side.
Mia:	It sounds like volleyball. 
Luke:	Not really. In volleyball there are six members in each team, but in sepak takraw, there must be three players from each team on the court.
Mia:	Yes, but they hit the ball over the net just like volleyball.
Luke:	Actually, no. In volleyball, you must hit the ball with your hands, but in sepak takraw, you mustn't touch the ball with your hands. You can use your head, knees, feet or chest – that's why it's a bit like football.
Mia:	It sounds quite difficult.
Luke:	Yes, it is, because the net is high. You must be very fit to play this game.
Mia:	Do you need special equipment to play?
Luke:	Well, the ball isn't an ordinary ball. A sepak takraw ball is very light and it's got lots of little holes in it. But apart from the ball, you just need a net and a good pair of trainers. There's a sepak takraw team at my school and I'm thinking of joining – it's great exercise.
Mia:	Well, have fun Luke.
Luke:	There's a team for girls, too. You should try it, Mia.
Mia:	No, thanks. I like sport, but sepak takraw sounds very difficult.
