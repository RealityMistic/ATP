Lily:	First of all, I think it's really amazing that Sir Richard Branson has achieved so much. When he was a student at school, he didn't do well at all because he had dyslexia. In fact, he left school when he was 16 years old. However, this didn't stop Branson. In 1972, when he was only 22 years old, he built a recording studio and started his first big company, the famous Virgin Records. Since then, he has been doing many exciting projects and has started many other companies. His airline, Virgin Atlantic, is very famous, but he has also started a train company and a mobile phone company. Branson's interested in space tourism, too. He's been dreaming about space travel since he watched the moon landings in 1969. In the future, he's planning to offer flights to space. But Branson isn't only a businessman. He started his first charity when he was only 17, and he has been donating a lot of money ever since then. He's been working to save the environment for many years and he has made a significant contribution to protecting the Earth. For example, he's donated millions of dollars to fight global warming. In addition to all this, Branson has done some really exciting and adventurous things. He's flown in a hot-air balloon over both the Atlantic and the Pacific Oceans! He's really done a lot with his life! 
Teacher:	Thank you, Lily. I really enjoyed your talk!
