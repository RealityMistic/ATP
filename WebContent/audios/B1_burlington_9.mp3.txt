Conversation 1
Sarah:	Hello, Tim. It's Sarah. What's that noise? Where are you?
Tim:	Hi, Sarah. I'm in the town centre.
Sarah:	Well, it's very noisy. Unless you talk louder, I won't hear a thing you say! What are you doing there?
Tim:	You won't believe this. I'm looking for some clothes and I'm on my own too!
Sarah:	If you'd told me, I would have come with you. I love that new shopping centre. The only problem is that when I go there, I buy things I don't even need.
Tim:	I'm actually not at the shopping centre, Sarah. You see, I'm going on holiday next week and I only need some T-shirts and shorts for the beach, so I'm at the market. But I'm so bad at shopping - I hate it. If you were with me, it would be much easier. You could help me choose! 
Sarah:	Oh, Tim. I would - but it's nearly 5 o'clock and I've got my dance class on Wednesdays. I would have cancelled if I'd known. 
Tim:	I don't mind going shopping again - maybe this weekend. If you're free, will you come with me? How about Sunday?
Sarah:	Actually, if we go on Saturday, it's better. The market and shopping centre are open till late. So - see you Saturday, OK?

Conversation 2
Callum: 	Hello, Amy. It's Callum.
Amy:	Hi, Callum. I'm at Rick's party. It's his birthday and he's having a party at the swimming pool in the sports centre. I'm having a great time - I'm dancing with Rick right now! I'll send you a photo on WhatsApp. But why don't you come too? I miss you! If you were here, it would be perfect!
Callum: 	Oh, I don't think I can â€¦
Amy:	Why not? Where are you?
Callum: 	I'm with Lily at the cinema. We always see a film on Saturday night. Then, if we're hungry, we go for a pizza and ice cream. You know, if Rick had invited us to the party, we might have changed our plans. 
Amy:	Oh, come on! This is better than a film. Bring Lily, too! I'm inviting both of you!
Callum: 	OK - I'll ask her. If she agrees, we'll come.
