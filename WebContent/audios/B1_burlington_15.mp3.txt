Mr Peters:	Hello, Mrs Ellis. I understand you witnessed the robbery at the George Square Bank this morning. We'd like to ask you some questions about what you saw. I realise you are upset but this must be done now, right after the event, while you still remember what happened.
Mrs Ellis:	I'm not sure I can help. It all happened so quickly. 
Mr Peters:	Let's take it one step at a time. Where were you when it happened? 
Mrs Ellis:	I was in the bank waiting in the queue when suddenly, two men rushed in.
Mr Peters:	I see. At what time was that?
Mrs Ellis:	It was around a quarter to eleven.
Mr Peters:	Uh huh - quarter to eleven. OK. What did the robbers look like? 
Mrs Ellis:	One was tall with short black hair. He was wearing a mask over his eyes, so I can't describe his face. I'm pretty sure he had a large tattoo of a bird on his arm, though.
Mr Peters:	A large tattoo of a bird on his arm. OK. And what about the other robber?
Mrs Ellis:	Ah, he was quite short. I can't really describe him because he was wearing a hood, so most of his face was covered. 
Mr Peters:	What about the people in the bank? Were there a lot of customers?
Mrs Ellis:	Maybe 10 or 12.
Mr Peters:	So, what happened?
Mrs Ellis:	The tall robber pulled out a gun and shouted, "Lie on the floor!" The short robber pointed his gun at the bank teller. "Put all your money in this bag!" - that's what he said! Well, the poor girl handed over all the money. 
Mr Peters:	Did you notice anything else?
Mrs Ellis:	Yes, I saw the get-away car. The robbers ran out of the bank into a blue car and drove off.
Mr Peters:	That's very helpful. And did you see the car's plate number?
Mrs Ellis:	Oh, no. Everything happened so fast!
Mr Peters:	I see, Mrs Ellis. Was anyone hurt in the robbery?
Mrs Ellis:	Well, while the robbers were escaping, they pushed old Mrs Fletcher to the floor. Poor woman! 
Mr Peters:	How badly was she injured?
