Mum:	How many sweatshirts do you want to buy?
Tim: 	A few.
Mum:	How often do you wear sweatshirts?
Tim: 	A lot.
Mum:	OK. Look at this one, Tim. Do you like it?
Tim: 	I don't think so, Mum. It's a hoodie. Skaters wear hoodies and I'm not a skater.
Mum: 	A skater? What do you mean?
Tim: 	You know, Mum. Skater. Skaters usually wear big T-shirts or hoodies. And they also wear shorts or jeans, and their clothes are always very big. It's a style.
Mum: 	What other styles are there?
Tim: 	Oh, there are lots!
Mum: 	Do you see that boy in the black T-shirt? Is he a skater?
Tim: 	Which one? The boy looking at the wallets?
Mum: 	Yes.
Tim: 	No, Mum. He's a Goth. Skaters like wearing a lot of colours. They don't wear much black and the girls don't usually wear any make-up. But Goths love black.
Mum: 	So, skaters wear colourful clothes and Goths wear black?
Tim: 	Right! Do you see those girls near the shoe shop? They're Goths, too. They're wearing black T-shirts and black jeans. The girls also like black make-up and black nail varnish. Their jewellery is black, too.
Mum: 	What about those girls over there? Are they Goths?
Tim: 	No, they're Emos.
Mum: 	Emos? What a funny name!
Tim: 	Do you think so? The name Emo is short for "emotional rock". That's the type of music they listen to. Some people say Emos are unhappy but many claim to be simply sensitive. Emos usually wear jeans and small T-shirts. They wear some black clothes, but they like colours, too.
Mum: 	Look at their hair! It's long and in their faces. I can't see their eyes! And that girl's hair is blue.
Tim: 	Right, Mum! Emos sometimes have blue or pink hair.
Mum: 	Hmm ... so, what are you Tim?
Tim: 	Me? I don't care about styles. I'm happy with a T-shirt, jeans and good trainers.
Mum: 	OK, Tim. Let's go and buy you some new trainers.
