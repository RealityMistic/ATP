A: 	I saw a fascinating documentary on YouTube last night. It was about the city of Teotihuacan. I'd never heard of Teotihuacan before.
B: 	Where's that? In Peru?
A: 	No, it's in Mexico, only 30 miles from Mexico City.
B: 	So what's so interesting about it?
A: 	The fact that no one knows who built it - they've researched data about the city for years, but its origins are still a complete mystery.
B: 	Really?
A: 	Yes. The Aztecs found the city when they arrived in Mexico. When they got there, they found an abandoned city, and they wondered who had lived there.
B: 	Where had all the inhabitants gone?
A: 	That's the thing - no one knows. The Aztecs thought that gods had built the city. That's why they called it Teotihuacan. It means â€˜the place where the gods were born' in the Aztec language. But no one has ever got to the bottom of this mystery.
B: 	Do they know how old the city is?
A: 	Yes. It was built a thousand years before the Aztecs arrived. They think it was a big busy city between 100 BC and 650 AD, with more than a hundred thousand inhabitants.
B: 	So, they've got no idea where 100,000 people went?
A: 	Well, they've developed lots of theories. Maybe climate change, a natural disaster or some other occurrence destroyed the city's food, and the people left.
B: 	Do you think they'll ever solve this mystery?
A: 	So far, they've only excavated five per cent of the area of the city. They keep revealing more and more evidence of what happened. The trouble is, the inhabitants had no system of writing, so they left no written records. Also, they haven't found any images of kings or royal tombs.
B: 	Sounds like an interesting documentary.
A: 	You can watch it on YouTube, too!
