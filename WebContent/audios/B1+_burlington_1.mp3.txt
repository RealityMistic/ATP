Jake: 	My name is Jake. I'm a secondary school student in Queensland, Australia. I'm mad about health and fitness, so I've decided to become a fitness trainer. I'm lucky because I can get a fitness trainer certificate at school. I can even start earning money. Next year I'll be working with a fitness trainer one day a week. I suppose it'll be difficult because we'll have lots of exams, too, but we don't have to study traditional subjects, such as history and maths. We can choose subjects that are important for our training programme and future jobs. As you can see, I've already planned my future and I'm really looking forward to getting my certificate.

Anita:	Hi, I'm Anita. I'm 16 and I study in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. We have to study 11 subjects at school, including biology, chemistry, maths, literature and Portuguese. Some of the students in my class have also started learning career skills for jobs in fields like hotel management and construction. At the end of the last year of secondary school, we all take the "Ensino m√©dio" exam. We need this to get into university. My friends have been complaining about all the homework we get, but it doesn't bother me. I want to be a lawyer one day, so I'm determined to study hard and get into a good university. Wish me luck!

Ian:	I'm Ian. I'm a student at secondary school in Manchester, England. Next year we're going to start studying for A-level exams. A-levels are important because you need them to get into university. You have to choose three or four subjects. The problem is I can't make up my mind. My father thinks I should take physics, biology and chemistry. It appears that he wants me to become a phorensics scientist like him, but I can't stand the sciences and I don't think I could examine blood and hair samples all day. I'm passionate about music, so I might study music, drama and dance. It seems to me that the most important thing is to do subjects you enjoy.
