Megan:	What are you doing your history project about, Owen?
Owen:	I'm writing about polymaths in history.
Megan:	What's that?
Owen:	It's a person with many abilities or jobs. Try to guess the name of this one, Megan. He received the Nobel Peace Prize for his work.
Megan:	Well, that's not enough information to guess his name! Where is he from?
Owen:	He's from Germany.
Megan:	When was he born?
Owen:	He was born in 1875 and he died in 1965.
Megan:	That's a long time ago! 1875-1965 â€“ so he lived to be 90 years old. What did he do?
Owen:	He did many things. First, he was a professional musician. He played the organ. He was very good at it and he gave concerts. In fact, he invented new methods of building organs. He also went to university to become a pastor at a Protestant church. He taught at university and he wrote books.
Megan:	Wow! That's amazing. He had four professions. He was a musician, a pastor, a teacher and a writer. Most people are lucky to be good at one thing.
Owen:	That isn't all. One day, he read an article about the poor people in the Congo in Africa. He left his job at the university and he went to medical school to become a doctor. After he finished medical school, he went to Africa. He started a hospital there and he helped thousands of people. He became famous and, in 1952, he received the Nobel Peace Prize for his work.
Megan:	He sounds like a great man. But I still don't know who he is. What's his name?
Owen:	Albert Schweitzer.
Megan:	Albert Schweitzer. Of course! Why didn't I guess? We learned about him in our history lesson.
Owen:	Yes, I remember that lesson, Megan. You slept during the entire lesson!
