As you have all probably noticed, the effect of global warming on the UK has created warmer summers and lighter winters, with spring arriving earlier each year. Recently, scientists warned the government that floods would be one of the biggest problems in the UK in the near future. Global warming is causing serious problems for the plants and wildlife of our country. Many of our native flowers are blooming early because of higher temperatures. According to a recent study of 405 different plant species, plants are now flowering earlier in the UK than at any time in the last 250 years. The problem is "timing". In the reports that I read, scientists explained that the early arrival of spring confused the flowers, birds and insects. Flowers depend on certain insects to pollinate them. When flowers come out early, insects aren't around to pollinate them. Sometimes things happen the other way round. Certain insects begin their migration to the UK early because of warmer weather, and when they arrive, the flower they depend on for food hasn't flowered yet. In either case, the plants and pollinators are together for less time. This means less food for the insects and less reproduction of the plants. The early arrival of spring also affects birds. Young birds usually hatch when there is a lot of food to eat, like insect eggs and caterpillars. Scientists explained that because of climate change, some birds were hatching before there was enough food for them in nature and that reduced their chances of survival. The period between spring and autumn in England is about a month longer now than it was at the beginning of the last century, so you can imagine how confused these birds are. And now if you're confused, too, this is your chance to ask me your questions.
