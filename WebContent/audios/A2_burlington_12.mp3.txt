Liz:	Hi Sam. How's it going?
Sam:	Oh, Liz. Yeah, OK. How are you?
Liz:	I'm alright. Sam, why weren't you at Mike's party?
Sam:	Party? What party? I wasn't invited!
Liz:	Of course you were. Look on your phone, there's a message there from Mike, we all got the same message.
Sam:	I don't think... wait a minute! I've got a new phone and I forgot to give everyone my new number.
Liz:	What? No wonder!
Sam:	Sorry! When was it?
Liz:	On Saturday night.
Sam:	That's a pity. I wasn't busy then. I was watching TV and it was quite boring! So, anyway – how was the party?
Liz:	Well, it was a bit disappointing, really.
Sam:	Why, what happened?
Liz:	Well, it was at that new club for under 18s in Main Street.
Sam:	The Red Pirate?
Liz:	Yes, that's the place. Well, Janet and I went together. We were walking to the club and Janet fell and hurt her leg. Then, Dana and Saul had an argument. Saul was shouting at Dana because she forgot to bring the birthday cake. The place was really crowded, and at about 10 o'clock, everyone was dancing and the electricity went off.
Sam:	You're right – it doesn't sound like it was much fun. 
Liz:	Mmm. The food was excellent, though.
Sam:	Yeah? What did you have?
Liz:	There was pizza with olives, hot dogs and chips ... and crisps of course.
Sam:	But no birthday cake!
Liz:	No. Oh, but there was delicious chocolate ice cream. What are you doing, Sam?
Sam:	I'm sending you all my new phone number. I don't want to miss another party!
