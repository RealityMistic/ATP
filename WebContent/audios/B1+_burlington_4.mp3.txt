A: 	I'm reading a fascinating book about dolphins. You'd never believe how similar dolphins are to humans.
B: 	They are very intelligent, aren't they?
A: 	Yes, they are. In fact, some scientists think they are more intelligent than humans. But it isn't just their intelligence which makes them similar to us, it's their social behaviour, too.
B: 	Is that what the book's about? The way dolphins get along with each other?
A: 	Yes. It's all about the complex societies they form, how they treat each other and share their lives.
B: 	So what does it say about dolphin societies?
A: 	Well, they live in family groups like we do. A group can have two to 40 dolphins. But they don't just stay with that group. They socialise with other groups and form friendships and alliances, just like us.
B: 	So they have a circle of friends outside their families. I imagine a dolphin never feels left out.
A: 	And when they meet other dolphins, they touch fins as if they were doing a kind of handshake.
B: 	Really?
A: 	Yes. They've also got names that they whistle to identify themselves. Other dolphins can repeat these names, and scientists have found that they can remember these names for up to 10 years.
B: 	Wow! So if a dolphin got separated from its best friend, it would still remember its name 10 years later?
A: 	That's right. Just like us. You'd remember me if we were separated for 10 years, wouldn't you?
B: 	Hmm, yes, I suppose I would.
A: 	And dolphins are very considerate of each other. If a dolphin is in danger, it can whistle a distress signal and other dolphins will come to help.
B: 	This book sounds really interesting. Have you nearly finished it?
A: 	Yes. If I finish it before the end of the week, I'll bring it to you in class.
