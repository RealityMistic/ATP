Jasmine:	Hi, Mike.
Mike:	Hi, Jasmine. Are you having a good Christmas holiday?
Jasmine:	Yes, I am. It's very windy in London and the weather forecast said that it would rain. But we're having a great time. There's so much to do here!
Mike:	That's great! It's freezing here in Newcastle … and there's ice on the ground. Are you staying in a hotel?
Jasmine:	No, we're staying with my Dad's sister.
Mike:	Where are you now?
Jasmine:	I'm at the Southbank Centre.
Mike:	What's the Southbank Centre?
Jasmine:	It's a cultural centre next to the River Thames. There's a theatre and a café and there are some fantastic shops. You can buy everything here. There are shops with toys, books and clothes. There's a winter festival here at the moment and there are Christmas lights everywhere. Let me hold up my netbook. Can you see them?
Mike:	Yes, I can. They're really beautiful!
Jasmine:	Oh, look! It's snowing!
Mike:	Wow! It looks beautiful. You look like you're inside a snow globe! What are you doing now?
Jasmine:	We're waiting to buy tickets for the theatre.
Mike:	Which show are you going to see?
Jasmine:	It's called Slava's Snowshow. Slava Polunin is a famous clown from Russia. Dad said that the show was really special.
Mike:	Oh, I read a review about it. It said that it was one of the best shows in the world!
Jasmine:	Yes. I heard that, too. I can't wait to see it. Are you doing anything special today?
Mike:	Yes, I think so. My brother said that he wanted to go ice-skating with me this afternoon.
Jasmine:	Oh? Where can you go ice-skating in Newcastle?
Mike:	There's a place to go ice-skating next to the Life Science Museum.
Jasmine:	Oh, of course. Now I remember. You told me that it would be open soon. That's great! I hope you enjoy it, Mike.
Mike:	Thanks! Enjoy the show, too. Let's talk on Skype again tomorrow. OK?
Jasmine:	OK. Bye for now.
