Linda:	How was your trip to Paris and Rome, Tom?
Tom:	The trip was OK, but I had a very unpleasant time getting there.
Linda:	Why? What happened?
Tom:	Well, first of all, my dad had planned to drive me to the railway station, but there was something wrong with the car and he couldn't start it. I took a taxi and luckily got to the station just in time for the train. After that, the first part of the journey was fine. The train went through the Channel Tunnel.
Linda:	The Channel Tunnel is great, isn't it? It saves a lot of time. Once I took a ferry to France. It took a long time!
Tom:	Definitely. We arrived in Paris in two hours and 15 minutes. Anyway, my friend Charlie and I had planned to meet in Paris and spend the day together. Well, Paris has got seven large railway stations, and Charlie got confused and waited for me at the wrong one! By the time I got to the train station, the battery of my mobile phone had died, so I couldn't call him. I didn't see him in the end and that was really disappointing. Then, while I was waiting at the station, someone stole my camera. I still don't know how it happened!
Linda:	That's terrible! Your camera was expensive, wasn't it?
Tom:	That's true, but I was more upset about losing all the photographs I'd taken while I was travelling in Yorkshire last month.
Linda:	That's terrible! How was the rest of your trip? Where did you go?
Tom:	Well, I finally got on the train to Rome. It was a night train and I was exhausted. All I wanted to do was sleep. I'd just fallen asleep when a group of young people got on the train and they were all very cheerful. Too cheerful, in fact. One of them was celebrating his birthday, so they were singing and talking loudly all night. I didn't sleep at all. By the time I got to Rome, I was really irritable!
Linda:	Poor Tom. I'm sure that's a journey you won't forget for a long time!
