This is a painting of Queen Victoria by George Hayter. It shows her immediately after she was crowned. She is the new Queen of England. As you can see, she is very young. In fact, Victoria was just 18 when she came to the throne in 1837. Look at the beautiful clothes that she is wearing. The gold and orange material shows the coronation robes which every monarch wears at the coronation ceremony. Here's a quote from the young Victoria's journal. These are the words that she wrote on the day she became Queen: "I really cannot say how proud I feel to be the Queen of such a Nation." Queen Victoria gave this painting to the National Portrait Gallery in 1900. She was on the throne for longer than any other king or queen of England before her. In fact, she reigned for longer than any other queen in the world - 63 years and 7 months. This is a record which was only broken in 2015 by Queen Victoria's great-great-grandaughter, Queen Elizabeth II. Please come with me. This is the room where we keep photographs. This is one of my favourite photographs of Queen Victoria, who is pictured here with her husband - Prince Albert. He was also her cousin. They got married in 1840 when Victoria was 21. They were very happy together and had nine children. Nine! Many of these children married into the royal families of Europe, so Queen Victoria's descendants became rulers all over the continent. Unfortunately, when Albert died in 1861, Victoria wore only black clothes and stopped appearing in public. Here's another photograph. It's from Victoria's funeral procession. She died in 1901. No one knows who took this photo. He - or she - is anonymous. As you can see, there were huge crowds of people. After all, she was a queen who was on the throne for more than 60 years.
