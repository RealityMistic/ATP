 Anne:	Hey, Dave! Are you doing anything this weekend?
Dave:	No, not really, Anne, why?
Anne:	Well, I was thinking ... do you want to do something together?
Dave:	That depends. Last time we did something together, it was a disaster! Remember the roller coaster at the amusement park? You got sick and we left early!
Anne:	Yes, I remember! Come on, Dave, that was months ago. Let's do something different.
Dave:	OK. Any ideas?
Anne:	Yeah, look at these ads in the newspaper. Do you feel like going to the Crestwood Music Festival?
Dave:	That sounds good. When is it?
Anne: 	It starts on Saturday morning at 10.00 and finishes at midnight on Sunday.
Dave:	That's two days. Where does everyone sleep?
Anne:	I suppose everyone brings a tent and goes camping.
Dave:	Yeah, well my parents aren't going to agree to that! What else is there?
Anne:	Well, there's Dalton Lake Water Park. Let's see … it says there are rides and a beach.
Dave:	No, Anne, I went there last year. It was terrible! The beach was crowded, the rides were boring and there wasn't anything to eat. Hey, what about this? There's an event at the National Forest this weekend.
Anne:	Let me see. Hmm... aerobics lessons, a 10-kilometre walk, cross-country cycling …. no way, Dave! 
Dave:	Why not? It sounds like fun!
Anne:	Fun? It's just a lot of exercise! No, sorry, I'm not going. I hate exercise and I never do sport at the weekend.
Dave:	But there's going to be a barbecue with steaks.
Anne:	Fine, Dave. You go to the forest and eat steak. I'll stay home and order a pizza!
