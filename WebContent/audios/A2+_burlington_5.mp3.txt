Olivia:	Dan, can I look at your photographs?
Dan:	Yes, sure Olivia. They're from carnivals all over the world.
Olivia:	Wow! There are so many!
Dan:	Yes, well, I've been abroad six times since last year and taken part in six carnivals!
Olivia:	Where are these photos from?
Dan:	That's the Verona Carnival in Italy.
Olivia:	Why is there a carnival in Verona?
Dan:	Well, over 500 years ago there wasn't enough food in Verona. It was a difficult time and many people became ill and died. A rich man gave the people food and wine. Since then, people have celebrated with a huge carnival for two weeks every winter. At the end of the carnival, people get food to remember the story.
Olivia:	Wow, look at these masks! Are these photos also from the Verona Carnival?
Dan:	No, they're not. I took them in Italy but they're from the Venice Carnival. It's famous for its elegant masks. There's been a carnival in Venice for over 800 years. Today, over three million people visit the Venice Carnival every year. I took a lot of pictures in Venice but I got lost there many times too! There are hundreds of narrow streets in Venice and they all look the same!
Olivia:	... and look at these pictures. These people look like they're performing in a circus.
Dan:	Yes, this is the Lan Kwai Fong Street Carnival in Hong Kong. There are parades of acrobats, dancers and singers. It's amazing. The carnival is great for food lovers. You can eat delicious local food there.
Olivia:	... and what carnival are these photos from?
Dan:	That's the Notting Hill Carnival in London! You were with me.
Olivia:	Oh, of course.
Dan:	Do you know when the Notting Hill Carnival started?
Olivia:	 ... Um. I think it started in the 1800s.
Dan:	No, it didn't. It started in 1964. The idea for the carnival came from the famous carnival in Trinidad. For the first time, people played traditional Caribbean steelband music in the streets of London and everybody loved it.
Olivia:	I love the music, too. We had a wonderful time that day.
