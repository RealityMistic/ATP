John:	Hey Kristy, did you go to the new amusement park over the summer holiday? I took my younger brother and we had an amazing time.
Kristy:	Yes, I went with some friends at the beginning of the holiday. We also enjoyed it. There were so many things to do. We didn't know where to start. What did you do, John?
John:	My brother is very young so he'd got to go on everything, but he really enjoyed the carousel. He thought it was so cool that it got to ride an elephant instead of a horse like in most carousels. What was your favourite attraction?
Kristy:	I liked the water rides. It was a hot day, so we spent a few hours on those.
John:	Oh, I love water rides. But I liked the arcade the best. We played for hours. There was a basketball game and I won a toy lion for my brother. He was so happy.
Kristy:	Did you eat at any of the restaurants at the park? We ate at a really interesting one. The waiters just had these characters from history. There was even a history trivia game and I won, thanks to Mr. Parker's great lessons.
John:	You are so clever. We ate at a fun restaurant too. We sat on pillows on the ground instead of chairs.
Kristy:	That does sound fun. We should goto the the amusement park together one weekend.
John:	Yeah, let's do that soon.
