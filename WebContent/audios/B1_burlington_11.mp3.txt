Jamie:	Hi, Erin. How was dinner with Zach and Katie last night? Did you enjoy it?
Erin:	Oh, Jamie - don't even ask! My wonderful idea to have a dinner of French food was a disaster!
Jamie:	I'm sure it wasn't as bad as that, Erin!
Erin:	No, it's true! From the very start, everything went wrong. First of all, the onion soup was too salty.
Jamie:	OK. Salty soup isn't a disaster. 
Erin:	But things went from bad to worse! I planned to make fish - you remember that spicy fish I made last month?
Jamie:	Yes, it was great.
Erin:	Well, that was from fresh fish. This time I had to use frozen fish. Anyway, I'd just put the fish on the table when the phone rang in the bedroom. Three minutes later, I was back in the kitchen and there was the neighbour's cat - sitting on the table! He obviously didn't mind eating icy fish because it was almost all gone! So, I had to throw out the fish and make some meat.
Jamie:	So you didn't have fish … meat is good, too.
Erin:	It wasn't. All this happened an hour before Zach and Katie arrived, so I did everything quickly. Even before we began to eat, there was a problem. It turned out that Katie had stopped eating meat! She's become a vegetarian. So I made her a cheese sandwich. Then, when Zach and I started eating, the meat wasn't cooked enough! It was raw in the middle!
Jamie:	I see … I guess the meal didn't go so well then …
Erin:	That's not all! I made a delicious cherry cake. It's one of the most difficult cakes to make and it took me two hours to prepare. Yesterday, right before Zach and Katie arrived, I decorated the cherry cake with a lot of cream - and guess what? The cream was sour! I can't believe I forgot to taste the cream before using it. But maybe that was lucky because it turns out that Zach is allergic to cherries!
Jamie:	Never mind, Erin. The next time you invite Zach and Katie, your meal can only be better than this one. The problem is that they probably won't want to come again!
Erin:	Very funny, Jamie!
