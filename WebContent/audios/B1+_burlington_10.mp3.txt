Haru: 	Hi! My name is Haru and I'm a secondary student in Kobe, Japan. We have to study eight subjects this year, including Japanese language, maths, science, music, art and sport. I also study English as an extra subject. I've got two more years at this school. I want to be an engineer one day, so I'm determined to study hard and do well. My parents want me to go to a yobiko next year. It's a special school where you have extra classes after school and at weekends, too. The lessons at this cram school help prepare you for university entrance exams. It's going to be awful because I won't have any free time, but most of my friends are going, too. It's normal here in Japan.

Sonia: 	Hi! I'm Sonia and I'm 16. I'm a student at a secondary school in Zaragoza, Spain, doing Bachillerato. This year we can specialise, so I've chosen art subjects. I'm studying history of art, technical drawing and my favourite ... computer-assisted design. I'm mad about art and design, and when I finish school, I'm going to go to art school in Vitoria. I can't make up my mind which course to study yet. I want to be a graphic designer or an architect. I'm lucky because my father also loves art and painting, and I think I've inherited his talent for painting.

Paul: 	Hello. My name is Paul and I'm nearly 16. I'm at a secondary school in Alberta, Canada. I go to an English-language school, but there are French-language schools here, too. Next year, I'm going to study six obligatory subjects, including maths, English and science. I also have to choose some optional subjects. I might do computer and technology studies because I want to get a job that pays well in the future. That's important to me. It seems to me that the best way to get a good job is to learn computer skills.
