Gaby:	Hi, Paul. What book are you reading?
Paul:	Oh, hi Gaby. I'm reading Scoop. It's an old book. It was written in 1938 and it is considered one of the best novels of the 20th century.
Gaby:	Really?
Paul:	Yes. Scoop was also made into a film, a TV series and a play.
Gaby:	But what does scoop mean?
Paul:	Well, sometimes a good news story is discovered by a news reporter and that reporter is the first person to write about it. That story is called a scoop.
Gaby:	I see. So what's the book about?
Paul:	Well, there was a writer called John Boot. He lived in London but he wasn't happy there and he wanted to move. His friend Mrs Stitch volunteered to help him.
Gaby:	What did she do?
Paul:	Well, Mrs Stitch's friend Lord Copper owned a newspaper. He needed a news reporter to discover a scoop in Africa.
Gaby:	So, did John Boot go to Africa and discover a scoop?
Paul:	No, not exactly.
Gaby:	Why? What happened?
Paul:	Well, Lord Copper made a mistake. You see, there were two men with the same family name. There was John Boot and William Boot.
Gaby:	William Boot? Who's William Boot?
Paul:	William Boot was John's cousin, but they didn't know each other. William Boot was a writer for the newspaper. He lived outside London and wrote about flowers and birds. He didn't want to go to Africa! He didn't know how to survive in Africa.
Gaby:	So what happened?
Paul:	Lord Copper sent William Boot to Africa, not John Boot. William reached Africa, and there were some other news reporters trying to get a scoop there. They fought a lot and stole ideas from each other. And guess what?
Gaby:	What?
Paul:	William Boot discovered a scoop! He returned to London and Lord Copper was very happy. He wanted to give Boot a prize.
Gaby:	And ... don't tell me ... the prize was given to the wrong Boot!
Paul:	That's right!
