 Emily:	Hi, Dan! It's Emily. Where are you?
Dan:	Oh, hi Emily. I'm in the Lake District. I'm on holiday with my family. We're sleeping in a tent in the mountains.
Emily:	A tent? That's great. Are you having fun?
Dan:	Um... well, it's a bit cold.
Emily:	So, what are you doing there?
Dan:	Well, my father and mother are on a boat on the lake at the moment. They're fishing.
Emily:	Fishing? I hate fishing.
Dan:	Yeah, I hate it, too, that's why I'm not fishing with them. I'm sitting on the beach.
Emily:	What are you doing on the beach? Can you swim?
Dan:	No, not really. The water's too cold.
Emily:	What about your sister? What's she doing?
Dan:	Oh, she's got lots of friends here. I think she's playing football.
Emily:	And what about your little brother? What's he doing?
Dan:	He's sitting next to me. He's playing in the sand.
Emily:	To be honest, Dan, it sounds quite boring.
Dan:	Well, it's only another two days â€“ we leave on Tuesday. Listen, my sister's calling me. I've got to go. See you soon.
Emily:	Yeah, OK. Enjoy the rest of your holiday.
Dan:	Ha ha, very funny!
