Erin: 	Hey, Tim. Are you feeling better?
Tim:	Thanks, Erin. I'm much better. I'm sure I'll be back at school by tomorrow. What homework have we got?
Erin:	Last week, we finished reading H.G. Wells' book The Time Machine in our literature class. Now Mr Elliot wants us to prepare for a class discussion about it.  
Tim:	OK - how do we prepare?
Erin:	We're to imagine that we've already got the technology for time machines and he wants us to think about this question: If you travel ten years into the future, what will you bring with you.
Tim:	That's not so hard. If I ride a time machine to the future, I'll take my laptop. If there are any new computer programs or games, I'll download them onto my laptop and bring them back with me. I bet there'll be some really cool new computer games that I can play with my friends when I get home.
Erin:	Well, if we go into the future, I won't take my laptop. It's big and I want to put clothes in my bag. I'll take my smartphone.
Tim:	If you take your smartphone, what will you do with it?  
Erin:	For a start, if there are any new apps in the future, I can download them onto my phone. And a smartphone isn't heavy or big – so I can take it with me everywhere. Also, if I see anything interesting, I'll take pictures and then I'll use Whatsapp or Instagram and send them back to our friends. They'll be really jealous! 
Tim:	Sorry, Erin. But I'm not sure Whatsapp or Instagram can send pics back to the past. I think that if we visit the future, we'll see lots of new technology. All today's new technology will be old.
Erin:	You know what - you're right - so maybe we should think of other things to take.    
Tim:	Like what?
Erin:	I think I'll take my dog with me. If I take my dog with me, it'll be fun and we can do things together.   
Tim:	Your dog! That's an original idea and I'm sure Mr Elliot will like it. I guess we're ready for the class discussion. I'll see you tomorrow.
Erin:	OK – see you then.
