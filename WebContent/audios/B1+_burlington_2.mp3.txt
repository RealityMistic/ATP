Peter: 	Hi, Uncle Joe, it's Peter.
Joe: 	Hello, Peter. Good to hear you. I haven't seen you for weeks.
Peter: 	I had seven exams in three weeks, so I haven't been out much, but now I've got six weeks' holiday.
Joe: 	Are you doing anything special?
Peter: 	Yes, I'm going mountain climbing in Wales tomorrow. My bus leaves early in the morning.
Joe: 	That's exciting.
Peter: 	Yes. You went mountain climbing in the past, didn't you? Can you give me some advice?
Joe: 	Yes, I did a lot of mountain climbing when I was young, but these days I prefer playing golf.
Peter: 	I'm sure you can give me some tips.
Joe: 	What do you want to know?
Peter: 	Well ... Is mountain climbing dangerous?
Joe: 	It can be very dangerous. There are so many things that can go wrong while you're climbing a mountain. You have to be prepared.
Peter: 	Don't worry - I'll be prepared.
Joe: 	Just remember, don't take unnecessary risks. How many people are going?
Peter: 	There are ten of us. Six of us are still learning, but there are four experienced climbers to look after us.
Joe: 	It's important to go in a group. You must never climb a mountain on your own. Have you got good climbing boots?
Peter: 	Yes, I've just bought some climbing boots and they're great. They're very comfortable.
Joe: 	Great. What about training? Have you had any lessons? You need to learn some skills before you start climbing a mountain.
Peter: 	I've done a week's starter course at the indoor climbing centre in Glasgow. I learnt how to use the equipment and they taught us about being safe on the mountain. We did a lot of physical training, too.
Joe: 	Ah, I know the trainers in Glasgow. They're very good. I'm sure you've learnt all the important things. You'll be fine.
Peter: 	I can't believe it - I haven't dared to take risks in the past, but this time tomorrow I'll be mountain climbing!
