William:	Quick, Grace, let's get started on our project before my brother comes home and wants the computer.
Grace:	OK. So ... what animal do you want to write about?
William:	Bats.
Grace:	Bats? No way! What about parrots? Parrots are the prettiest birds and they're more interesting than bats, too.
William:	I think bats are the most interesting animals, Grace. And I bet no one else is doing bats. Come on – let's do something different.
Grace:	Well, OK. I suppose bats are also birds.
William:	Bats aren't birds, Grace! They're mammals. They're the only mammal that can fly.
Grace:	Mammals, really? Hmm. Maybe they are more interesting than parrots. Where do bats live?
William:	Let's look it up on the Internet. Here's something. According to this, bats live all over the world. They prefer warm weather, so they're more common in hot countries than in cold countries.
Grace:	Do they always live in caves?
William:	No. Many types of bats live in trees. In fact, there are bats in the trees in our garden.
Grace:	Really? That's frightening.
William:	No, it's good. Those bats eat insects in the garden. They aren't as quick as birds, but some bats can catch 1,200 insects in an hour.
Grace:	1,200 insects in an hour? That's amazing. What else do they eat?
William:	Some bats eat fruit. When they eat fruit, seeds from inside the fruit fall to the ground and new trees grow there. So bats help the environment, too.
Grace:	So bats are actually our friends.
William:	That's right – even the vampire bat can help people.
Grace:	The vampire bat? Is that real?
William:	Yes, it is. But it drinks the blood of animals – not of people.
Grace:	Is that how it helps people – by not drinking our blood?
William:	No, silly. Scientists make medicine from a chemical in the vampire bat's mouth. This medicine can save people's lives.
Grace:	That's incredible! You're right. I think our project will be the best one in the class.
