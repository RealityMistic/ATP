Jane:	Hi, Lucy. What are you doing this afternoon?
Lucy:	I'm going to visit my little sister.
Jane:	What do you mean!? I'm your little sister!
Lucy:	That's true, Jane, but now I've got another little sister. I've become a volunteer for the Big Brothers Big Sisters Organisation.
Jane:	What's that?
Lucy:	It's an organisation that helps children and teenagers. Many of them haven't got many close family members who they can talk to, like older siblings, grandparents, aunt or uncles. I visit a twelve-year-old girl whose mother works in the evenings. Her name's Irena.
Jane:	What do you do with her?
Lucy:	I help Irena with her homework and we talk and listen to her favourite music.
Jane:	You don't help me with my homework!
Lucy:	Well, you've got Mum and Dad to help you. Irena doesn't live with her Dad and her Mum hasn't got time to help her.
Jane:	What else do you do together?
Lucy:	Sometimes we go for walks or play basketball in the park.
Jane:	Oh, so that's why my basketball keeps disappearing.
Lucy:	Ha ha! Yes. Sorry!
Jane:	Can anyone be a big sister? I want to help someone, too.
Lucy:	No, you aren't old enough.
Jane:	What are you going to do today?
Lucy:	Um .. First, I'm going to help Irena with her homework. Then we're going to walk to a farm where people can go horse-riding.
Jane:	Oh, do you mean Ridley Farm? I love going there.
Lucy:	Yes, I'm taking Irena there because she loves horse-riding.
Jane:	Can I come, too?
Lucy:	No, you can't. I'll take you to the farm on Saturday. OK?
Jane:	OK!
