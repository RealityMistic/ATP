Elizabeth:
My name is Elizabeth Jones. I'm 13 years old and I'm from England. I've got one brother and one sister. My parents live in Kent, but I go to a boarding school in London. People are often surprised to hear I go to a boarding school, but I love it! We sleep at the school. We don't go home every weekend, but we do go home on holidays. I enjoy school because we do so many interesting things. I also like being with my friends all day. I study computers every day. I also like music and I play the guitar in a pop band with three other girls. We really like the group One Direction. I think they're brilliant, but my favourite is Robbie Williams. We play many of his songs. In the evenings, my friends and I watch music videos on TV. At weekends, we meet at the shopping centre near our school. I get pocket money every week and sometimes, I buy CDs. My best friend Lisa likes buying clothes, and we often go to the clothes market in the centre of town. All in all, I'm really happy at school.
