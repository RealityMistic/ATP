Mum: 	Hey, Alex, come and look at this website.
Alex:	What is it, Mum?
Mum:	It's a website of special holiday experiences for teenagers. They combine volunteer work with fun activities. This one sounds ideal for you. It's a trip to Costa Rica.
Alex:	Costa Rica? Where's that?
Mum:	In Central America. The weather there is pleasant for most of the year and it isn't too hot during the summer.
Alex:	Wow! So tell me about the trip.
Mum:	OK. You travel to Costa Rica with a group of teenagers. The group is quite small, so you will make friends more easily than in a big group. You see the country, but you also volunteer there.
Alex:	Really! That sounds interesting. How long is the trip?
Mum:	It's three weeks. First, you fly to San Jos√©. It's the largest city in Costa Rica and it's very lively.
Alex:	And what do we do there?
Mum:	You volunteer in a children's centre. You help the children with their homework, do art and do sport with them.
Alex:	Sounds great! What else do we do on the trip?
Mum:	Well, you go hiking, safely we hope, in Chirripo National Park for four days. There are tropical evergreen forests with trees as tall as 15-storey buildings. Then you climb Cerro Chirripo, the highest mountain in the country. They say the views from the top of the mountain are extraordinary!
Alex:	How high is it?
Mum:	It's 3,820 metres high.
Alex:	Phew! The highest mountain in England isn't as high as that! What do we do next?
Mum:	Then you travel to small villages near the sea and help build schools there. During this period, the volunteers need to work hard. But, the most exciting part of the trip is the last two days. You spend a night camping and two days rafting. What do you think?
Alex:	I think I really want to go! It sounds better than going on holiday with you and Dad!
