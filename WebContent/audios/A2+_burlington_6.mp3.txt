Mum:	Hi, Jake. I'm preparing supper.
Jake: 	Great! I'm hungry. What are you making?
Mum: 	I'm making a Greek salad. It's really healthy. It's got vegetables, olives and feta cheese in it. We're going to eat a balanced diet from now on and this salad has got a lot of protein and vitamins in it.
Jake: 	But we usually have a big meal for supper with protein and carbohydrates like fish and chips or meat and potatoes.
Mum:	Well, not any more. It's much better to eat a large lunch and a smaller supper. Starting from today, we're going to change our diet. We're going to try the Mediterranean diet â€“ a lot of fresh vegetables and fish, fruit for dessert, and small amounts of cheese and meat.
Jake:	What about pasta, potatoes and bread?
Mum:	Carbohydrates are good at lunchtime. You don't have to eat bread in the evening. I think we should all try this diet and see how we feel.
Jake:	And fats? We need fats in our diet to give us energy.
Mum:	Yes, but the fats we eat in junk food are unhealthy. We're going to get most of the fat we need from olive oil. It gives us energy and scientists say it protects us against diseases like cancer and diabetes. Do you know, scientists have studied the Mediterranean diet for a number of years?
Jake:	Oh, and what have they found out?
Mum: 	People eating this type of diet are healthier and live longer.
Jake: 	So, if we eat a Mediterranean diet, will we live longer?
Mum:	Well, I can't promise you that! But I can promise you we'll feel better and have more energy. But the Mediterranean diet isn't just about eating a balanced diet. It's about having a healthy lifestyle. We must exercise more and get a lot of fresh air. So, I won't drive you to school any more. You have to walk from now on!
